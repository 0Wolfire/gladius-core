    	<p>
    	This is a partial demonstration of how to create a custom loader for a
    	new resource type, in this case a model from a collada file. Note that
    	the collada resource type is currently implemented in the engine core.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	A complete implementation would provide access to raw meshes and
    	materials rather than creating new entities, and would generate entity
    	templates, which the engine does not yet support. Finally, the loader
    	itself is intended to be generic enough to load resources for arbitrary
    	rendering backends.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	Once the implementation is unit tested and no longer experimental, 
    	the collada resource and loader will be fully supported as part of the 
    	engine core.
