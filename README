0. WHAT, WHY, and WHO
   ------------------

1. VERSION NUMBER
   --------------
Paladin version numbers have the following form:

    A.B.C.D    

A is the major version. It increments whenever we make a significant change or backward compatibility
is broken. B is the minor version. It increments when a new feature, or set of smaller features, are
introduced. C indicates the development stage, chosen from 0 (experimental/alpha), 1 (test candidate),
2 (testing/beta), 3 (release candidate), 4 (release). D is the revision number. In general, the last
version in each stage is identical to the first version in the following stage (i.e., the final
release candidate is the same as the next release).
